A regular expression is a string which contains some normal characters and some meta characters. The meta characters include,

. means any character

[c1-c2] means any character between c1 and c2 (c1 and c2 are two characters)

[^c1-c2] means any character not between c1 and c2 (c1 and c2 are two characters)

* means the character before it can occur any times

+ means the character before it can occur any times but at least one times

\ means any character follow should be treated as normal character



Input:Every two lines of the input is a pattern-matching problem.

 The first line is a regular expression, and the second line is the string to be matched. 

 Any line will be no more than 80 character.

 A line with only an "end" will terminate the input.



Output:For each matching problem, you should give an answer in one line. If no substring matches the regular expression, print the input string.
